Kalimba
-------

Version 2019-07-23

This sound bank has been created from real instrument recordings, thanks to
Xavimart (Javier), a musician that maintains a collection of musical
instruments from many places around the world. He granted us access to his
collection and helped with the performance and recording for all day long.

The kalimba was recorded on January 2019 by Xavimart, Gonzalo
<humanogonzalo@gmail.com> and Roberto <roberto@zenvoid.org>, with two Zoom H1
portable recorders. Raw recordings were cropped, edited, and processed by
Roberto, using free software programs.

This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is available on the
FreePats project web pages: http://freepats.zenvoid.org/Ethnic/kalimba.html
